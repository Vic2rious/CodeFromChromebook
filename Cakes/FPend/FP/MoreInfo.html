	  <li><h1>Public Transport</h1>
<p>Most of the city’s cultural life is situated in the center of the city. Therefore, walking is the best option to navigate the city. However, if you need to use the public transport, we are here for you! Sofia has it all – trams, buses, trolleybuses, marshrutka (a local type of mini-bus). Public transport in the city is very affordable at a fixed rate of 1.60BGN (around 0.80EUR) per journey. A day card for unlimited use of all public transport will cost you 4BGN (around 2.00EUR).

<li> <h1>Rent-A-Car</h1>
Renting a car is a good option if you are planning on exploring what Bulgaria has to offer outside of the capital. However, if you are just visiting for a few short days and are not planning any day trips, Sofia’s compact city center and public transport network are more than enough for you to explore what the city has to offer.  </li>
